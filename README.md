# Regression-Model
The generalized version of the minimal Python package structure is designed for modeling on the All of Us or synthetic FHIR data with proper abstraction and placeholders for researchers or developers to plug in their own variable names, data sources, and model types.

**Prerequisites**

A working Python 3.10 environment.

Git installed to clone the repository.

Access to a Jupyter Notebook in All of Us workbench.

**Setup Guide**

To get the project up and running in a new Jupyter Notebook environment, follow these steps in the exact order specified. This sequence has been tested and is designed to resolve dependency conflicts in environments like the All of Us workbench.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
First, open a terminal in your Jupyter environment and clone the project repository. This will download all the project files, including the requirements.txt file.

Bash

_git clone https://github.com/Lakshmi2819/regression_model.git_

_cd regression_model_


**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Open a new Jupyter Notebook and run the following two cells in order. This process ensures all dependencies are installed correctly, addressing version conflicts with pre-installed packages.

Cell 1: Install the Project from Git
This command installs the twinsight_model project itself, along with its core dependencies. The --force-reinstall flag helps to clear any incompatible packages from the environment.

Python

_! pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/Lakshmi2819/regression_model_


Cell 2: Install Additional Requirements
This command installs any remaining or additional dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

Python

_!pip install -r requirements.txt_

IMPORTANT: You must restart the kernel after running this cell to ensure all newly installed packages are loaded correctly.
In Jupyter, go to 'Kernel' -> 'Restart Kernel'.


After restarting the kernel, you are ready to proceed to the next step.

**Project Structure**
The repository contains the following key files and directories:

Cox_model.ipynb: A sample Jupyter Notebook for running the model.

twinsight_model/: The main Python package containing the model's logic.

pyproject.toml: Defines project metadata and dependencies.

requirements.txt: A comprehensive list of all package dependencies with pinned versions.

Usage
Once you have successfully completed the setup steps and restarted your kernel, you can import the necessary modules in a new notebook cell and begin using the project.

Python

from twinsight_model.dataloader_cox import load_configuration, load_data_from_bigquery
from twinsight_model.preprocessing_cox import split_data, create_preprocessor, apply_preprocessing, OutlierCapper
from twinsight_model.model_cox import run_end_to_end_pipeline

Troubleshooting
NumPy 1.x vs 2.x Conflict

If you encounter an ImportError or a NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.x warning, it is a sign of a dependency conflict. This is common when installing an environment on top of a pre-configured one. The solution lies in the specific order of installation provided in the Setup Guide, which ensures that a compatible version of NumPy (1.26.4) is correctly installed.
